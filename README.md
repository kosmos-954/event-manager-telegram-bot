# Event management bot for Telegram

The bot can help with basic event management tasks: sign up, cancel, remind and process waiting lists.

## Install

-   Register a bot, configure access token and administrators, build and start.
-   Check /help for event creation format.
-   Invite your audience to sign up using the link returned in response.

## To do

-   Internationalization. (The initial language choice was to help my Russian friends leaving in Europe organize events for children and mothers fleeing war in Ukraine.)
